We think cookie banners can be a bit of a nuisance.

That said, understanding how our website helps you on your journey in AI and medicine is important to us. So we've opted for cookie-banner-free visits with anonymised, GDPR-compliant page view tracking with zero reliance on cookies or your browser's local storage. We collect simple analytics to help improve our services, and you can rest assured your personal data or your individual usage of our site isn't being tracked.

We only use your browser's local storage for keeping tabs on your selected appearance (i.e., light, dark, or system) between visits, so your experience stays just the way you like it. Feel free to check (<Kbd>⌘⌥I</Kbd> on macOS, <Kbd>F12</Kbd> on Windows)!
