## What we do

### Speaker events

CU AIM consistently invites distinguished speakers from academia and industry alike to share their cutting-edge research and insight into AI in medicine.
Previous events included learning about AI in surgery from Abhishek Ambekar of CMR Surgical and the role of AI in the longevity industry from Ian Inkster of the Ageing Analytics Agency.

### Teaching events

We offer large, interactive classes through which we introduce students to machine learning and data analysis, and then guide them through applying these techniques across an array of medical fields.

### Networking events

We pride ourselves on being a place where students can collectively share experiences of AI in medicine and learn from others.
CV building and Career workshops

At CU AIM, we hope to inspire and drive students towards careers involving AI in medicine.

We help students tailor their experiences for application to internships and jobs. By welcoming back CU AIM alumni who were successful in securing such positions, we give students first-hand insight into how to explore and nurture their interests through real-world opportunities.
